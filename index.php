            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>
                At Shunji Railways, we put safety first.
                This means we have some rules for our stations and trains
            </p>
            <h4>At the station</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't board the train after the whistle has been blown.
                    You could fall off the platform.
                </li>
                <li>Form a line and don't push people, they might fall on the rails.</li>
                <li>
                    Stay behind the yellow lines on open platforms.
                    You could be hit or sucked onto the rails by a passing train.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Inside the train</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Don't leave luggage laying on the walking path.
                    Someone might trip.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hold onto something when standing inside the train,
                    or you might fall over.
                </li>
                <li>Don't open the doors until the train has fully stopped</li>
                <li>
                    If theres a emergency,
                    contact our train staff using the emergency panels located next to the doors.
                    In live threatening situations, call the emergency number (112).
