Welcome to the new Shunji Railways repository

## About this project
This is a project for my IT portfolio.
The website of the fictional company Shunji Railways is where travellers can find everything they need for their next trip. Whether they need to know when a train departs, find safety info about our stations, or want to buy a souvenir online, ths website is the place for that.
